    <p>
      After the last major release in December 2016, Tobago 4 comes with
      127 changes, bugfixes and new features in December 2017.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, the step to version 4 is quite compatible,
      so the migration is easy. Please follow the
      <tc:link label="Migration from Tobago 3 to 4"
               outcome="/content/10-intro/50-migration/96-migration/migration40.xhtml"/>
      guide.
    </p>
  </tc:section>

  <tc:section label="New Features and Enhancements">

    The highlights are
    <ul>
      <li>Update to Bootstrap 4 beta 2</li>
      <li>Reimplementation of grid layout mananger and split layout manager</li>
      <li>CSP Level 2</li>
    </ul>

    The full list is available in
    <tc:link label="Jira" image="fa-external-link"
             link="https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/TOBAGO/versions/12338728"/>.

    <b>Layout Managers</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Grid Layout was reimplemented with use of the modern CSS grid</li>
      <li>Split Layout was reimplemented (was not available in Tobago 3)</li>
      <li>Segment Layout was enhanced: TODO offset</li>
      <li>Flex Layout was enhanced: ? TODO</li>
      <li>
        The syntax of the layout attributes are refactored to be compatible to modern CSS.
        E.g. use of "fr" as unit for fraction in grid layout.
        The old syntax works also, so not migration is needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Reimplementation of Inline Styles</b>
    <p>
      Is better and faster, because not use of JavaScript is needed now.
      This is possible with CSP Level 2.
