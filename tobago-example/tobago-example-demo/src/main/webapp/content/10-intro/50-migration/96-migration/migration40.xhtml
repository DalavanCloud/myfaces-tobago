  <tc:section label="Migration from Tobago 3.0 to 4.0">

    <p>
      There are some migration steps to do, dependent on the application
      you want to migrate. The steps can be classified by
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tag library</li>
      <li>CSS / Bootstrap</li>
      <li>Theme building</li>
    </ul>

    <tc:section label="Tag Library">
      <tc:section label="&lt;tc:bar&gt;">
        <p>
          The content of <code>&lt;tc:bar&gt;</code> needs to be checked.
          The layout inside of the bar has been changed by CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Example: TODO (look the change in the Tobago demo header bar)
          <!-- todo -->
        </p>
      </tc:section>
    </tc:section>

    <tc:section label="CSS / Bootstrap">
      <p>
        The included Bootstrap CSS library has been updated from
        <tc:link link="http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2016/10/19/bootstrap-4-alpha-5/" label="v4.0.0-alpha.5"/> to
        <tc:link link="http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2017/01/06/bootstrap-4-alpha-6/" label="v4.0.0-alpha.6"/>.
        Thought some changes need to be made, if you use Bootstrap classes directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the generated HTML code has been changed, mostly in these tags:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>&lt;tc:menu&gt;</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>&lt;tc:box&gt;</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>&lt;tc:bar&gt;</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here you may need modifications only, if you have own CSS with are related with these tags.
      </p>
    </tc:section>

    <tc:section label="Theme building">
      <p>
        Building a theme is in general compatible, but if using the build mechanism of Tobago
        (defined in the pom.xml of tobago-theme) it can be better automated.
        The build mechanism now uses _tobago.scss from tobago-core to generated the CSS file,
        the is no longer a manual copy needed.
      </p>
