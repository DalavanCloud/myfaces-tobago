  <p>
    Sometimes it might be useful to define
    <tc:link label="HTML Meta Tags" value="https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/meta"/> in a page.
    You can set e. g. search keywords anywhere on a page like
    <pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;tc:meta name="keywords" content="tobago,demo"></code></pre>
    The result is a meta tag in the HTML head.
