    <h3>A WYSIWYG HTML editor</h3>
    <p>
      You can embed HTML editor in Tobago easily,
      but there is no HTML editor component in Tobago.
      The reason is, there a many web-based editors in the web available, with different
      licences, different features (and different bugs).
    </p>
    <p>
      So Tobago should not implement it's own HTML editor.
      But Tobago may embed an existing editor. Such an editor needs to comply with these requirements:
      <ul>
        <li>License must be compatible with the Apache 2.0 license.</li>
        <li>Should be easy to integrate.</li>
        <li>Should have many features.</li>
        <li>Should have few bugs.</li>
        <li>Must be compatible to CSP (Content Security Policy).</li>
      </ul>
      Unfortunately we didn't found the <em>perfect</em> editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that doesn't matter. You can choice you favorite editor and integrate it in your application.
      In this application there are two editors embedded as an example.
      <ul>
        <li><tc:link link="http://www.tinymce.com/" target="_blank" label="TinyMCE"/></li>
        Is using LGPL license.
        <li><tc:link link="http://ckeditor.com/" target="_blank" label="CKEditor"/></li>
        Doesn't work with CSP activated.
        There is an issue #8584 in the
        <tc:link link="https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/8584" target="_blank" label="issue tracker"/>
        of the project.
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>About security</h3>
    <p>
      The application should be protected against invalid or malicious HTML content.
      If the application uses an HTML editor in the browser, an attacker is able to modify the clean code
      and submit malicious code.
      That must be checked on server side!
    </p>
