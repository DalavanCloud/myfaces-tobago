      <p>
        This page opens a different window while loading.
        The second window might be a status of a background process, but in this demo it only show the server time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the basic configuration of JSF 2.0, there is a problem, with server site state saving. If a number of
        views reloaded in the 2nd window, the 1st window will lost it's view state and cannot process a submit.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will result in a ViewExpiredException.
      </p>
