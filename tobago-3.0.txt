Some notices and ideas (which aren't on the home page).

  - Use box-sizing: border-box (requires IE 8) (required for Bootstrap)
  - Use min/max-width/height (requires IE 9 (IE 8 have bugs (see caniuse.com)))
  - Use n-th child (requires IE 9 and FF 3.5)
  - Better: Using Flexible Box Layout Module (requires IE 10, might be emulated with JavaScript)
  - TBD: consolidate LinkRenderer, ButtonRenderer with CommandRenderer
