The generation uses Docbook 1.68.1 XSL and Saxon 6.5.3. These programs/libraries
are not included in this distribution. You have to download them by yourself:

  http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/

  http://saxon.sourceforge.net/

You need to specify the following build properties that must point to the saxon
jar file and the docbook directory. The last one specifies the saxon extension
of the docbook distribution.

  <property name="saxon.jar" value="../../../saxon-6.5.3.jar"/>
  <property name="docbook.dir" value="../../../docbook-xsl-1.68.1"/>
  <property name="docbook.saxon-extension.jar"
            value="${docbook.dir}/extensions/saxon653.jar"/>
