 Migration from Tobago 1.0 to 1.5

Migration from Tobago 1.0 to 1.5 (work in progress)

   Tobago 1.5 has a lot of changes compared to Tobago 1.0.
  
   The good news: Most of these changes are made internally in Tobago.
   If you use Tobago, you don't have to change too much.
  
   The amount of things you have to change in your application depends 
   on how do you use it. 
   On the Tobago Tag Library are very few changes made.
   On the Tobago Java Classes are more changes. 
   Here you can see which changes has been made.
   
   There are also @Deprecated annotations in the code and some
   logging warning when using deprecated code.
   Please keep an eye on it.

   Some of the UIComponent classes has been renamed or restructured,
   to get a consistent result. The used UIComponents where generated
   and have super classes with an "Abstract" as prefix.
