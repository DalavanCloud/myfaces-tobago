Apache Tobago

  The goal of Apache Tobago\u2122 is to provide the community with a well designed set of user
  interface components based on JSF and run on MyFaces.

  Tobago is more than just a tag library. The following statements characterize
  Tobago and make it different from other frameworks:

  * The focus of Tobago is to create business applications without the need for HTML
    design. The development of Tobago pages follows more the development of
    conventional user interfaces than the creation of web pages.

  * The UI components are abstracted from HTML and any layout information that does
    not belong to the general page structure. The final output format is determined
    by the client/user-agent.

  * A theming mechanism makes it easy to change the look and feel and to provide
    special implementations for certain browsers. A fallback solution ensures that
    as much code is reused for new themes as possible.

  * A layout manager is used to arrange the components automatically. This means, no
    manual laying out with HTML tables or other constructs is needed.

  The development of Tobago started in 2002.
