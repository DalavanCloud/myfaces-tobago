+----------------------------------------


Building

  You need {{{http://maven.apache.org/download.html}Maven 2}} (at least 2.2.1)
  and {{{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html}Java 5}} to build Tobago 1.0.x
  or {{{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html}Java 6}} to build Tobago 1.5.x.


  In the
  {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/tobago/trunk/}main directory}}
  you can use

+----------------------------------------
  mvn install
+----------------------------------------

  to run the install target on all sub projects. This will
  put all necessary artifacts into your local repository.

Building All

   For building all the stuff you can use the profile all-modules

+----------------------------------------
 mvn install -Pall-modules
+----------------------------------------


The Demo

You can run the demo in tobago-example/tobago-example-demo with jetty

+----------------------------------------
  mvn jetty:run-exploded
+----------------------------------------

  the other examples with

+----------------------------------------
  mvn jetty:run
+----------------------------------------

  or

+----------------------------------------
  mvn package
+----------------------------------------

  and deploy the WAR from the target directory
  manually.

  The demo application will create a log file in the app-server
  starting folder. You may want to change that in
  {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/tobago/trunk/tobago-example/tobago-example-demo/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.xml}src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.xml}}.
