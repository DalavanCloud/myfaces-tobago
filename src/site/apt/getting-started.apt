Checking Out

  Check out the 1.5.x sources by running the following:

+----------------------------------------
  svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/tobago/trunk tobago
+----------------------------------------

  Check out the 1.0.x sources by running the following:

+----------------------------------------
  svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/tobago/branches/tobago-1.0.x tobago-1.0.x
+----------------------------------------


Building

  You need {{{http://maven.apache.org/download.html}Maven 2}} (at least 2.2.1)
  and {{{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html}Java 5}} to build Tobago 1.0.x
  or {{{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html}Java 6}} to build Tobago 1.5.x.


  In the
  {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/tobago/trunk/}main directory}}
  you can use

+----------------------------------------
  mvn install
+----------------------------------------

  to run the install target on all sub projects. This will
  put all necessary artifacts into your local repository.

Building All

   For building all the stuff you can use the profile all-modules

+----------------------------------------
 mvn install -Pall-modules
+----------------------------------------


Deploying the Demo

  To deploy the demo on your local Tomcat 5.5 create a
  ~/.m2/settings.xml file based on
  {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/tobago/trunk/settings-example.xml}settings-example.xml}}.

  Make sure the manager user has the role manager; see
  $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml.

  Change into the demo directory
  {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/tobago/trunk/tobago-example/tobago-example-demo/}example/demo}}
  and run

+----------------------------------------
  mvn tomcat:deploy
  or
  mvn tomcat:undeploy tomcat:deploy
+----------------------------------------

  Alternatively, you can run the demo with jetty

+----------------------------------------
  mvn jetty:run-exploded
+----------------------------------------

  the other examples with

+----------------------------------------
  mvn jetty:run
+----------------------------------------

  or

+----------------------------------------
  mvn package
+----------------------------------------

  and deploy the WAR from the target directory
  manually.

  The demo application will create a log file in the app-server
  starting folder. You may want to change that in
  {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/tobago/trunk/tobago-example/tobago-example-demo/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.xml}src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.xml}}.
