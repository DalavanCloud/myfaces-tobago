Building
--------
You need Ant 1.6.5 and Java 5 to build Tobago.
Currently we use the Maven 2 Ant tasks for
dependency management.

In the main directory you can use

  ant install

to run the install target on all sub projects. This will
put all necessary artifacts into your local repository.

Demo
----
To deploy the demo on your Tomcat. Create a
build.properties file based on build-sample.properties in
the main directory.

Make sure the manager user has the role manager; see
<tomcat>/conf/tomcat-users.xml.

Change into the demo directory example/demo and run

  ant deploy

Alternatively, you can run

  ant war

and deploy the WAR from the build/dist directory
manually.
